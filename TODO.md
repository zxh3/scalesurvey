- ✅ Extract shared form logic into SurveyForm component
- ✅ Support both create and edit modes with props

## Phase 8: Preview Mode for Question Editors ⏳ PLANNED

### 8.1 Add Preview Tab to Question Editors
**Goal:** Allow survey creators to preview how questions will appear to participants

**Approach:** Tab-based editor with Edit/Preview tabs
- Edit tab: Current editor UI (configuration)
- Preview tab: Shows ResponseComponent with live interaction

**Implementation Plan:**
1. ⏳ Install shadcn/ui Tabs component if needed
2. ⏳ Create reusable `QuestionEditorLayout` wrapper component
   - File: `src/components/survey-builder/question-editor-layout.tsx`
   - Wraps editor content in Tabs (Edit/Preview)
   - Handles preview state management
   - Renders ResponseComponent in preview tab
3. ⏳ Refactor all 5 question editor components to use the layout:
   - `src/components/questions/single-choice/single-choice-editor.tsx`
   - `src/components/questions/multiple-choice/multiple-choice-editor.tsx`
   - `src/components/questions/text/text-editor.tsx`
   - `src/components/questions/rating/rating-editor.tsx`
   - `src/components/questions/scale/scale-editor.tsx`

**Benefits:**
- Reuses existing ResponseComponent (DRY)
- Live preview with actual interaction
- Participants see exactly what creators see
- Clean, familiar tab interface
- Works on all screen sizes

## Technical Notes

- All mutations need admin code authentication
- Use Convex real-time subscriptions for live results
- Store question configs and answers as JSON strings
- Use nanoid for generating survey keys
- Follow existing modular architecture for new question types
