---

## Phase 1: Complete Survey Creation Flow ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Implement Full Publish Functionality ✅
**File:** `src/app/create/page.tsx`
- ✅ Save all questions to database when publishing
- ✅ Serialize question configs to JSON strings
- ✅ Call question mutations for each question
- ✅ Call survey publish mutation after questions saved
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully

### 1.2 Question Validation ✅
**File:** `src/app/create/page.tsx`
- ✅ Validate all questions have titles
- ✅ Validate options have text (for choice questions)
- ✅ Validate at least 2 options for choice questions
- ✅ Prevent publish if validation fails

### 1.3 Update Survey Mutations ✅
**File:** `convex/surveys.ts`
- ✅ Add startDate and endDate to create mutation
- ✅ Handle date conversion (Date to number)

## Phase 2: Participant Survey View ✅ COMPLETED

### 2.1 Create Survey Response Page ✅
**File:** `src/app/survey/[key]/page.tsx`
- ✅ Fetch survey by key
- ✅ Check if survey is published and within date range
- ✅ Display survey title and description
- ✅ Render all questions using response components
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Submit responses

### 2.2 Create Response Submission ✅
**File:** `convex/responses.ts`
- ✅ Create `submit` mutation
- ✅ Validate survey exists and is active
- ✅ Store answers as JSON string
- ✅ Create queries for admin and live results

### 2.3 Survey Status Handling ✅
**File:** `src/app/survey/[key]/page.tsx`
- ✅ Show appropriate messages for:
  - Survey not found
  - Survey is draft (not published)
  - Survey not started yet
  - Survey has ended
  - Survey successfully submitted

## Phase 3: Admin Dashboard ✅ COMPLETED

### 3.1 Create Admin Access Page ✅
**File:** `src/app/access/page.tsx`
- ✅ Form to enter admin code with formatting
- ✅ Validate and redirect to admin dashboard
- ✅ Option to create new survey

### 3.2 Create Admin Dashboard ✅
**File:** `src/app/admin/[code]/page.tsx`
- ✅ Fetch survey by admin code
- ✅ Show survey details (title, description, status)
- ✅ Display survey URL for sharing with copy/open buttons
- ✅ Show question count and response count
- ✅ Display schedule information
- ✅ Action buttons based on status:
  - Publish (if draft)
  - View results (if published/closed)
  - Close (if published)

### 3.3 Create Results View ✅
**File:** `src/app/admin/[code]/results/page.tsx`
- ✅ Fetch all responses for survey
- ✅ Display response count
- ✅ Group responses by question
- ✅ Render results using result components
- ✅ Export functionality (CSV)
- ✅ No responses state

### 3.4 Create Edit Survey Page ⏭️ SKIPPED
**Reason:** Editing published surveys is complex and not needed for MVP. Surveys can be drafted and published once.

## Phase 4: Live Results ✅ COMPLETED

### 4.1 Participant Results View ✅
**File:** `src/app/survey/[key]/results/page.tsx`
- ✅ Check if survey allows live results
- ✅ Real-time subscription to responses using Convex
- ✅ Display aggregated results
- ✅ Auto-update when new responses come in
- ✅ Handle access restrictions

## Phase 5: Additional Question Types (Medium Priority)

### 5.1 Text Question Type ✅
**New Files:**
- ✅ `src/components/questions/text/text-editor.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/questions/text/text-response.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/questions/text/text-results.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/questions/text/index.ts`
- ✅ Register in `src/lib/questions/init.ts`

### 5.2 Rating Question Type ✅
**New Files:**
- ✅ `src/components/questions/rating/rating-editor.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/questions/rating/rating-response.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/questions/rating/rating-results.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/questions/rating/index.ts`
- ✅ Register in `src/lib/questions/init.ts`

### 5.3 Scale Question Type ✅
**New Files:**
- ✅ `src/components/questions/scale/scale-editor.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/questions/scale/scale-response.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/questions/scale/scale-results.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/questions/scale/index.ts`
- ✅ Register in `src/lib/questions/init.ts`

## Phase 6: Response Validation ✅ COMPLETED

### 6.1 Comprehensive Validation System ✅
**Goal:** Validate survey responses with type-specific rules

**Architecture:**
- Added `ValidationResult` interface (valid: boolean, error?: string)
- Added `validate` function to `QuestionTypeDefinition` interface
- Each question type implements its own validation logic

**Validation Rules:**
- **Single Choice:** Required check, valid option ID check
- **Multiple Choice:** Required, min/max selections, valid option IDs
- **Text:** Required, max length validation
- **Rating:** Required, range validation (1 to maxRating)
- **Scale:** Required, range validation (minValue to maxValue)

**Modified Files:**
- `src/types/questions.ts` - Added ValidationResult and validate to interface
- `src/components/questions/*/index.ts` - Added validate function to all 5 types
- `src/app/survey/[key]/page.tsx` - Updated to use type-specific validation

**Benefits:**
- Centralized validation logic per question type
- Type-safe validation
- Extensible for new question types
- Fixes min/max selection validation bug in multiple choice

## Phase 7: Preview Mode for Question Editors ⏳ PLANNED

### 7.1 Add Preview Tab to Question Editors
**Goal:** Allow survey creators to preview how questions will appear to participants

**Approach:** Tab-based editor with Edit/Preview tabs
- Edit tab: Current editor UI (configuration)
- Preview tab: Shows ResponseComponent with live interaction

**Implementation Plan:**
1. ⏳ Install shadcn/ui Tabs component if needed
2. ⏳ Create reusable `QuestionEditorLayout` wrapper component
   - File: `src/components/survey-builder/question-editor-layout.tsx`
   - Wraps editor content in Tabs (Edit/Preview)
   - Handles preview state management
   - Renders ResponseComponent in preview tab
3. ⏳ Refactor all 5 question editor components to use the layout:
   - `src/components/questions/single-choice/single-choice-editor.tsx`
   - `src/components/questions/multiple-choice/multiple-choice-editor.tsx`
   - `src/components/questions/text/text-editor.tsx`
   - `src/components/questions/rating/rating-editor.tsx`
   - `src/components/questions/scale/scale-editor.tsx`

**Benefits:**
- Reuses existing ResponseComponent (DRY)
- Live preview with actual interaction
- Participants see exactly what creators see
- Clean, familiar tab interface
- Works on all screen sizes

---

## Technical Notes

- All mutations need admin code authentication
- Use Convex real-time subscriptions for live results
- Store question configs and answers as JSON strings
- Use nanoid for generating survey keys
- Follow existing modular architecture for new question types
