# Scale Survey - TODO Action Items

## Current Status Summary

### ✅ Completed
- Landing page with hero, features, how-it-works, footer
- Dark mode with theme toggle
- Animated grid background
- Database schema (surveys, questions, responses)
- Convex backend mutations (surveys, questions CRUD)
- Modular question type system with registry
- Single choice and multiple choice question types
- Survey builder UI (/create page)
- Drag-and-drop for questions and answer options
- Survey settings (live results, scheduling)
- Success modal with admin code

### 🚧 Not Yet Implemented

## Phase 1: Complete Survey Creation Flow ✅ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Implement Full Publish Functionality ✅
**File:** `src/app/create/page.tsx`
- ✅ Save all questions to database when publishing
- ✅ Serialize question configs to JSON strings
- ✅ Call question mutations for each question
- ✅ Call survey publish mutation after questions saved
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully

### 1.2 Question Validation ✅
**File:** `src/app/create/page.tsx`
- ✅ Validate all questions have titles
- ✅ Validate options have text (for choice questions)
- ✅ Validate at least 2 options for choice questions
- ✅ Prevent publish if validation fails

### 1.3 Update Survey Mutations ✅
**File:** `convex/surveys.ts`
- ✅ Add startDate and endDate to create mutation
- ✅ Handle date conversion (Date to number)

## Phase 2: Participant Survey View ✅ COMPLETED

### 2.1 Create Survey Response Page ✅
**File:** `src/app/survey/[key]/page.tsx`
- ✅ Fetch survey by key
- ✅ Check if survey is published and within date range
- ✅ Display survey title and description
- ✅ Render all questions using response components
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Submit responses

### 2.2 Create Response Submission ✅
**File:** `convex/responses.ts`
- ✅ Create `submit` mutation
- ✅ Validate survey exists and is active
- ✅ Store answers as JSON string
- ✅ Create queries for admin and live results

### 2.3 Survey Status Handling ✅
**File:** `src/app/survey/[key]/page.tsx`
- ✅ Show appropriate messages for:
  - Survey not found
  - Survey is draft (not published)
  - Survey not started yet
  - Survey has ended
  - Survey successfully submitted

## Phase 3: Admin Dashboard ✅ COMPLETED

### 3.1 Create Admin Access Page ✅
**File:** `src/app/access/page.tsx`
- ✅ Form to enter admin code with formatting
- ✅ Validate and redirect to admin dashboard
- ✅ Option to create new survey

### 3.2 Create Admin Dashboard ✅
**File:** `src/app/admin/[code]/page.tsx`
- ✅ Fetch survey by admin code
- ✅ Show survey details (title, description, status)
- ✅ Display survey URL for sharing with copy/open buttons
- ✅ Show question count and response count
- ✅ Display schedule information
- ✅ Action buttons based on status:
  - Publish (if draft)
  - View results (if published/closed)
  - Close (if published)

### 3.3 Create Results View ✅
**File:** `src/app/admin/[code]/results/page.tsx`
- ✅ Fetch all responses for survey
- ✅ Display response count
- ✅ Group responses by question
- ✅ Render results using result components
- ✅ Export functionality (CSV)
- ✅ No responses state

### 3.4 Create Edit Survey Page ⏭️ SKIPPED
**Reason:** Editing published surveys is complex and not needed for MVP. Surveys can be drafted and published once.

## Phase 4: Live Results ✅ COMPLETED

### 4.1 Participant Results View ✅
**File:** `src/app/survey/[key]/results/page.tsx`
- ✅ Check if survey allows live results
- ✅ Real-time subscription to responses using Convex
- ✅ Display aggregated results
- ✅ Auto-update when new responses come in
- ✅ Handle access restrictions

## Phase 5: Additional Question Types (Medium Priority)

### 5.1 Text Question Type
**New Files:**
- `src/components/questions/text/text-editor.tsx`
- `src/components/questions/text/text-response.tsx`
- `src/components/questions/text/text-results.tsx`
- `src/components/questions/text/index.ts`
- Register in `src/lib/questions/init.ts`

### 5.2 Rating Question Type
**New Files:**
- `src/components/questions/rating/rating-editor.tsx`
- `src/components/questions/rating/rating-response.tsx`
- `src/components/questions/rating/rating-results.tsx`
- `src/components/questions/rating/index.ts`
- Register in `src/lib/questions/init.ts`

### 5.3 Scale Question Type
**New Files:**
- `src/components/questions/scale/scale-editor.tsx`
- `src/components/questions/scale/scale-response.tsx`
- `src/components/questions/scale/scale-results.tsx`
- `src/components/questions/scale/index.ts`
- Register in `src/lib/questions/init.ts`

## Phase 6: Polish & UX Improvements (Low Priority)

### 6.1 Loading States
- Add skeleton loaders for survey loading
- Add spinner for form submission
- Add progress indicators

### 6.2 Error Handling
- Better error messages throughout
- Toast notifications instead of alerts
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests

### 6.3 Responsive Design
- Test and optimize for mobile
- Improve touch interactions for drag-and-drop
- Adjust layouts for small screens

### 6.4 Accessibility
- Add ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation for drag-and-drop
- Focus management
- Screen reader support

## Phase 7: Advanced Features (Future)

### 7.1 Survey Templates

## Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Order)

1. **Complete Publish Flow** (Phase 1.1) - Unblock survey creation
2. **Survey Response Page** (Phase 2.1) - Enable participants to take surveys
3. **Admin Dashboard** (Phase 3.2) - Enable survey management
4. **Results View** (Phase 3.3) - Enable viewing responses
5. **Question Validation** (Phase 1.2) - Improve UX
6. **Text Question Type** (Phase 5.1) - Expand question options

## Technical Notes

- All mutations need admin code authentication
- Use Convex real-time subscriptions for live results
- Store question configs and answers as JSON strings
- Use nanoid for generating survey keys
- Follow existing modular architecture for new question types
